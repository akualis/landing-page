### **Follow the Akualis mascot on social media**

At **Akualis**, water is never far away… even when it hides in the most unexpected places.

That’s why our mascot, an adventurous, curious, and determined beaver, travels the world in search of water points.

From freshly opened ski resorts to overheated cities and unexpected locations, he shares his discoveries, his challenges, and above all his humor. Always driven by one simple message:

***L'eau ça se partage*** *(Water is meant to be shared)*

👉 You can now follow all his adventures on our social media channels:
