Last weekend, **Le Progrès** dedicated a few lines to **Akualis**!

This first appearance in the local press encourages us to keep moving forward with our mission: **making access to drinking water easier through a collaborative application**.

Born from a very concrete need in the field, Akualis now enables everyone to **locate, update, and share water points around them**.\
A simple and useful approach, driven by a committed community of **nearly 450 contributors**.

🙏 A big thank you to everyone who helps keep this project alive every day.\
And special thanks to **SEUX Cyrille** for this visibility — we hope it will help Akualis grow even further
