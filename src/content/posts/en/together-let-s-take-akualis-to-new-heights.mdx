2025 was a major milestone, featuring a complete graphic redesign of the app, the introduction of GPS route management, and new, more engaging rankings. We are incredibly proud of the progress we’ve made:

* Over 3,000 downloads.
* More than 500 contributors.
* Over 1,800 water points created or updated in the field.
* And even a media spotlight with a [great article in Le Progrès](https://akualis.com/en/blog/akualis-featured-in-le-progres) this summer!

Our [mascot](https://akualis.com/en/blog/follow-the-akualis-mascot-on-social-media), designed by Maxime, is also making its mark with over 50,000 views on social media. It’s a great start, but to make using a reusable bottle second nature for everyone and to massively reduce plastic waste, we need to be even more visible.&#x20;

### Our big project for 2026?&#x20;

We want your contributions to benefit as many people as possible. We are currently developing a feature to export your new water points directly to OpenStreetMap. This is a step close to our hearts: sharing information widely and making access to fountains simpler for everyone.&#x20;

#### Our goal for the new year: exceed 1,000 contributors!&#x20;

We’re counting on you to keep using the app, validating water sources during your outings, and above all, spreading the word about Akualis. You are our best ambassadors.&#x20;

The whole team is here to listen. Have an idea, a comment, or even a critique? Just reply to us—every bit of feedback helps us improve the tool.&#x20;

Thank you for joining us on this human and ecological adventure. And remember: water is meant to be shared!&#x20;

See you soon out in the field,
