    "missionParagraph": "As the need to reduce plastic use becomes urgent and heatwaves become more frequent, locating drinking water points, in both urban and rural areas, is a major challenge.\n\nAkualis's mission is to identify and make all drinking water points accessible by mapping them, and to promote responsible consumption of this precious resource.\n\nAkualis is not just a location tool; it is a collaborative platform that invites everyone to discover and share unknown water points or to validate those already listed. Thus, the database is enriched in real-time, offering reliable and up-to-date access to drinking water sources.\n\nThe intuitive and fun Akualis mobile application is more than just a tool; it's an adventure where each user becomes a water explorer.\n\nTogether, let's shape a world where access to drinking water is within everyone's reach.",

    "constat1Title": "Locating drinking water points is a constant challenge",
    "constat1ImageAlt": "Photo observation #1 - Locating drinking water points is a constant challenge",
    "constat1Text": "Who hasn't looked for a drinking water point to fill a water bottle, a baby bottle, or simply to quench their thirst? And who ended up buying a plastic water bottle, unaware that a fountain was likely just a few meters away?",
    "constat1Disclosure": "The location of the vast majority of fountains is public information, available notably on OpenStreetMap, and several actors have already undertaken the task of creating maps listing them. However, to date, none have succeeded in meeting the triple challenge of offering nationwide geographical coverage, guaranteeing the completeness of the data, while allowing for simple, real-time information updates.\n\nWith Akualis, we will address these three challenges thanks to our interactive and participative app. A gaming approach and advanced features will strengthen everyone's desire to contribute.",

    "constat2Text": "Did you know that every year, 6.5 million tons of plastic are dumped into the ocean, and that plastic bottles are among the top 10 items of waste collected on beaches?",
    "constat2Disclosure": "Where do they come from? Largely from our consumption on land. 9.3 billion liters of bottled water are consumed annually in France, even though the entire population is fortunate enough to have access to drinking water.\n\nFrance has set an ambitious goal to reduce the number of single-use plastic bottles by 50% by 2030. And Akualis wants to contribute to this goal by locating as many water points as possible to allow everyone to easily find a place to fill their water bottle.",

    "constat3Text": "A true public health issue, the WHO declares that access to safe drinking water is a universal human right and asks states to facilitate access to public fountains.",
    "constat3Disclosure": "In France, driven by the AGEC law, local authorities and public establishments are committed to the accelerated deployment of drinking water sources, but they are often not very visible and therefore little used.\n\nThanks to Akualis, these communities and public bodies will be able to more effectively inform citizens about the resources available to them. And app users will be able to fill their water bottles in the city, in train stations, in shopping centers with complete confidence.",
